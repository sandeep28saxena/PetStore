# How to push an update

FIRST AND ALWAYS
	1. GIT pull origin master

ONCE YOU HAVE PULLED AND IT SAYS EITHER ALREADY UP TO DATE, OR CHANGES MADE.

TYPE THIS - Expect to see a RED line of text that shows the file you are wanting to push
	2. GIT status
	
Type the following and add the file path	
	3. GIT add <filepath>
	4. GIT commit (you can also add -m "message" or wait for the note pad to open and type it in there.)

Finally once your files are green (type git status again at any time to check if you've added the files)

	5. GIT push origin master
